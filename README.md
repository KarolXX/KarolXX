#### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I work as Software Engineer in Warsaw where I deal with Spring Boot apps

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating backend applications (especially Java-based). I also try to build frontend usually using React, and less often pure Javascript and of course HTML and CSS
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Spring Security and external authentication and authorization with LDAP (Keycloak)
